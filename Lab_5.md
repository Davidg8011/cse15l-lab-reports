**LAB #5 David Guido**


1) The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Donâ€™t actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)

**Student Post**

* Hello, 
*
* I am having trouble debugging my code. The code can run from the terminal when I type "Javac Main.java" followed by java Main 15. However, I am not able to get the code to run from a bash script file



2) A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)


3) Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.


4) At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
a) The file & directory structure needed
b) The contents of each file before fixing the bug
c) The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
d) A description of what to edit to fix the bug
