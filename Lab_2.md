* How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain * why: Yes, the * * * count gets incremented by 1 as *it does with each call to HandleRequest. the string had the String "Hello" added which ultimately stores "1. * * Hello" when the Method call is done.

* the count will change to 2. The string will have "I hope this email finds you well" which by the end of the method makes the string "1. Hello * * 2. I hope this email finds you well"


* In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didnâ€™t know before. 
* I learned how the split() function works. I know understand how it finds s given char and then stores everything to the left in a array in index 0 and everything to the right of the char into the same array but in index 1.
